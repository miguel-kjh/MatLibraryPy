# MatLibraryPy

In this repository there is a numerical library to operate with matrices and vectors in python. Its implementation is done in both Boost-python and swig, where a global comparison of these two ways of implementing an API for C ++ operations in Python is investigated.

## Libraries

* [Boost-python 1.7](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_70_0/libs/python/doc/html/index.html)
* [Swig](http://www.swig.org/)
